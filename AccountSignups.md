# Signing up for Non-University Accounts

In this class, we'll be working with various digital platforms that will allow us to do tackle different parts of working with a digital archive. Our goal in using different platforms is not to make a perfect digital copy (Latin: per "thoroughly" +factus "made/ complete"), but to see how digitization work can look differently depending on expectations and uses.

One of our first steps is establishing an online public profile. This process will require that all students sign up for a number of different accounts (see below) in order to begin to establish a professional and an academic presence. We will set up a profile, first on hcommons.org, using your real name. BUT, if you have a reason to not want to use your real name, please let me know and together we can sort out another option.

# Humanities Commons

Humanities Commons will be a hub for much of our initial activity, acting as a repository for much of the information about each student's online profile. 

Visit [here](https://registry.hcommons.org/registry/co_petitions/start/coef:158) to sign up for a humanities commons profile.
After you have successfully registered, and perhaps worked a little on your profile, search for the group "Medieval Book @ Carleton" (or go to the group's [url](https://hcommons.org/groups/medieval-book-carleton/)) and click on the button in the header, "Join group".

# Twitter

We want to get you on the Twitter to encourage you to get familiar with what digital medievalists are talking about, what they are reading and what they are writing about. Twitter operates like medieval *fama* – an echo chamber of speech flitting about spreading rumours. With the immediacy of digital pseudo-presence,  Twitter collapses distance and difference. It is rarely obvious who is a senior scholar and who is a student, who is simply an interested on-looker and who is a hyper-specialist. Our goal in engaging with Twitter is for each of you to use it as a way to do some superficial research, network with other likeminded scholars and put yourself (and your work) out there....

Sign up for Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup).
Make sure to add your Twitter handle to your hcommons profile and, once you've joined our [slack group](https://digitalarchiving.slack.com), add your twitter to the channel, #twitter. 

Navigate to the professor's Twitter account and subscribe to the Twitter list [*DigitizingMedievalMss*](https://twitter.com/savrett/lists) on his [profile](https://twitter.com/savrett).

# ORCID

As it notes on their website, "ORCID provides a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher and, through integration in key research workflows such as manuscript and grant submission, supports automated linkages between you and your professional activities ensuring that your work is recognized." This means you create an indentity which allows your work to be identified as yours (including work completed in this course).

Register for an account [here](https://orcid.org). Add your level of education and, if you have published something, try to add it to your "Works". Click on "Add Works" button, and click either "search and link" using CrossRef Search or "Add manually". 
Add your ORCID identifier to your hcommons profile.

# Slack

To help with communication in this class, I want to try to avoid email or culearn, but instead will try to centralize communication through Slack. Slack is a group messanger application, that can be installed on your phone and tablet, used on your browser or a desktop app. 

# Github

A help guide for writing .md (Markdown) files. Text files on Github, such as this one, are usually written in this style. https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/

# Zotero

# Hypothes.is

# Google Calendar

We've incorporated the class schedule into an open Google Calendar. It will updated as we go along and you should receive notifications about the class schedule through Slack.
