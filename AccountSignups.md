# Signing up for Non-University Accounts

In this course, one of our first steps is establishing a online public profile. This process will require that all students sign up for a number of different accounts (see below) in order to begin to establish a professional and an academic presence. We will set up a profile, first on hcommons.org, using your real name. If you have a reason to not want to use your real name, please let me know and together we can sort out another option.

# Humanities Commons

Humanities Commons will be a hub for much of our initial activity, acting as a repository for much of the information about each student's online profile. 

Visit [here](https://registry.hcommons.org/registry/co_petitions/start/coef:158) to sign up for a humanities commons profile.
After you have successfully registered, and perhaps worked a little on your profile, search for the group "Medieval Book @ Carleton" (or go to the group's [url](https://hcommons.org/groups/medieval-book-carleton/)) and click on the button in the header, "Join group".
